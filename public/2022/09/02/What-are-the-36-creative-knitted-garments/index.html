<h1 id="What-do-they-look-like"><a href="#What-do-they-look-like" class="headerlink" title="What do they look like?"></a>What do they look like?</h1><p>The world’s first successful human-made satellites were the Soviet Sputniks, which were launched into orbit in 1957. Since then, satellites have become an indispensable part of modern life.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,000 active satellites orbiting Earth at any given time. They come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny CubeSats to massive communications satellites the size of a bus.</p>
<p>Most satellites are cylindrical, with a diameter of about three to four feet. They typically weigh between 500 and 2,500 pounds, and they orbit Earth at an altitude of about 220 miles.</p>
<p>Some satellites are designed to be reusable, like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. Others are one-time use only and burn up upon reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-they-do"><a href="#What-do-they-do" class="headerlink" title="What do they do?"></a>What do they do?</h1><p>Satellites play a variety of important roles in our lives. They provide communications services, help us navigate our way around the world, monitor weather conditions, and much more.</p>
<p>Communications satellites allow us to make phone calls and send text messages anywhere on Earth. Navigation satellites help us find our way around using GPS receivers. Weather satellites can provide data on storms and other hazardous weather conditions.</p>
<p>There are also numerous military and intelligence satellites that perform classified operations. These include spying on other countries’ military activities and gathering intelligence on their leaders and citizens.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-do-they-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-they-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do they cost?"></a>How much do they cost?</h1><p>The cost of launching a satellite into orbit varies depending on its size and complexity. Typically, it costs anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 per pound to launch a satellite into space. So a 500-pound satellite would cost somewhere between $2.5 million and $50 million to launch.</p>
<p>Satellites are becoming increasingly affordable as technology advances. Some companies, like SpaceX, are working on developing reusable rockets that could dramatically reduce the cost of launching payloads into orbit.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-knit-them"><a href="#How-do-you-knit-them" class="headerlink" title="How do you knit them?"></a>How do you knit them?</h1><p>Knitting socks can be a fun and challenging project, but it can also be a little daunting for first-time knitters. So, how do you knit socks?</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is knit a tube of fabric. This will serve as the sock’s body. To do this, cast on the required number of stitches using your preferred method (double-pointed needles, magic loop, or two circular needles). Knit in the round until the piece is the desired length - usually about 5”-6” shorter than the intended finished length of the sock.</p>
<p>Once you’ve knit the tube, it’s time to start knitting the cuff. This is the part of the sock that goes around your ankle. To do this, pick up stitches around the top edge of the sock tube. The number of stitches you pick up will depend on how wide you want your cuff to be. For example, if you’re knitting a child’s sock and want a 2” cuff, you would pick up 32 stitches. Knit in ribbing (k1, p1) for 1-2”.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to start shaping the toe. Decide how pointy or rounded you want your toe to be and divide your stitches accordingly. If you want a more pointy toe, decrease more frequently; if you want a more rounded toe, decrease less frequently. Work decreases until there are only 8-10 stitches remaining on each side of the toe. Cut yarn and pull through remaining stitches to close hole. Weave in ends.</p>
